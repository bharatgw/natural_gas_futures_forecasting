# natural_gas_futures_forecasting
This analysis was developed for SMU ECON207 Intermediate Econometrics. I develop a dynamically complete time series model to answer the hypothesis whether the price of natural gas futures is responsive to changes in temperature forecasts.

The PDF file is the submtted project file recording my analysis alongside pieces of the relevent analysis. The RMD file contains the entire code necessary for feature engineering, visualisations and model development.
